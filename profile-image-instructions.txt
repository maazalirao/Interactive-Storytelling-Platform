Instructions for Adding Your Profile Image with Cyber Effects:

1. Before saving the image, edit it as follows:
   - Crop the image to focus on the upper area (primarily the face and upper body)
   - Apply "cyber" style effects using an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Pixlr or Canva:
     * Add blue/cyan color overlays or gradients
     * Apply digital/tech-inspired filters
     * Consider adding subtle grid lines or tech elements
     * Increase contrast and vibrance for a more digital look

2. Save the edited image as "maaz-profile.jpg" to the following location in your project:
   C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\NChau\JavaScript\React\Interactive-Storytelling-Platform\src\assets\images\maaz-profile.jpg

3. Make sure the image is saved with the exact filename: maaz-profile.jpg

4. After saving, restart your development server with:
   npm run dev

Your profile should now display your name (Maaz Ali Rao) and your cyber-styled profile picture with additional effects applied through CSS, including:
- A glowing cyan/blue gradient overlay
- A pulsing border effect
- Automatic cropping to focus on the upper portion of the image
- A verification badge

Note: If you encounter any issues with importing the image, you might need to:
- Make sure the image is in a web-compatible format (jpg, png)
- Verify permissions on the folder where you saved the image
- Try clearing the browser cache if the image doesn't update right away
