# How to Fix GitHub Contributions Not Showing Up

Based on the analysis of your Git config and commit history, I've identified that your commits are dated in the future (April 1, 2025). GitHub doesn't count future-dated commits in your contribution graph.

## Steps to Fix:

1. Verify your GitHub email:
   - Your current Git email is: `abrahamlincoln1027@gmail.com`
   - Make sure this email is added and verified in your GitHub account settings

2. Fix the commit date issue:
   - Open GitHub settings page: https://github.com/settings/profile
   - Make sure "Include private contributions on my profile" is checked
   - Set your system date and time correctly (it's currently set to 2025)

3. Create a new commit with the correct date:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "abrahamlincoln1027@gmail.com"
   git config --global user.name "Maaz Ali"
   
   # Make a small change
   echo "# Fixed contribution tracking" >> README.md
   
   # Add and commit
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Fix contribution tracking with correct date"
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push
   ```

4. Wait up to 24 hours:
   - GitHub may take up to 24 hours to update your contribution graph
