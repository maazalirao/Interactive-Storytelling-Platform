# How to Fix GitHub Contributions Not Showing Up

Based on the analysis of your Git config and commit history, I've identified that your commits are dated in the future (April 1, 2025). GitHub doesn't count future-dated commits in your contribution graph.

## Steps to Fix:

1. Verify your GitHub email:
   - Your current Git email is: `abrahamlincoln1027@gmail.com`
   - Make sure this email is added and verified in your GitHub account settings
